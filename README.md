This repository contains the code implementation for joint channel estimation and data detection in MIMO systems with transmitter noise.
**File**
- simu_plat_JED.m: Main script for running the simulation.
- ls.m: Script to evaluate LS-based channel estimation and LMMSE-based data detection.
- The GAMP implementation is located in the AMP folder, while the MF-VB-I and LMMSE-VB-I implementations are contained in the VB folder.
